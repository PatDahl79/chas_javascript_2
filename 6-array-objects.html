  // This task pulls together the previous two tasks to practice a more "real" data
  // structure you'd see regularly as a web developer.
  //
  // Consider the following array of product objects:
  const products = [
    { name: "Camera", brand: "Canon", model: "EOS 70D" },
    { name: "Camera", brand: "Nikon", model: "D3400" },
    { name: "Camera", brand: "GoPro", model: "Hero 4" },
    { name: "Drone", brand: "DJI", model: "Phantom" },
    { name: "Drone", brand: "GoPro", model: "Karma" }
  ]

  // Task 1: Write a .forEach function which iterates through the products
  // and uses console.log() to print the name and brand of each item.

  //Using the forEach method to iterate through the products and print the name and brand of each item:
  products.forEach((product) => {
    console.log(`Name: ${product.name}, Brand: ${product.brand}`);
  });

  // Task 2: Use .map() to iterate over the products and return the model from
  // each product. Assign the result to a variable called `models` and use console.log()
  // to print it.
  
  //Using the map method to iterate over the products and return the model from each product, 
  //assigning the result to a variable called models:
  const models = products.map((product) => {
    return product.model;
  });

  // and using console.log() to print it: (for all the products)
  console.log(models);
